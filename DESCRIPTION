Description: HiCcompare provides functions for joint normalization and difference detection in multiple Hi-C datasets. 
    HiCcompare operates on processed Hi-C data in the form of chromosome-specific chromatin interaction matrices. 
    It accepts three-column tab-separated text files storing chromatin interaction matrices in a sparse matrix format 
    which are available from several sources. HiCcompare is designed to give the user the ability to perform a comparative
    analysis on the 3-Dimensional structure of the genomes of cells in different biological states.`HiCcompare` differs 
    from other packages that attempt to compare Hi-C data in that it works on processed data in chromatin interaction 
    matrix format instead of pre-processed sequencing data. In addition, `HiCcompare` provides a non-parametric method 
    for the joint normalization and removal of biases between two Hi-C datasets for the purpose of comparative analysis. 
    `HiCcompare` also provides a simple yet robust method for detecting differences between Hi-C datasets.
